# pacman
This project simulates a Pacman character chomping his way from the horizontal ends of the browser

To create this project, a function called run is executed every 200ms that adjusts the pacmans position by the width of the pacman. This function also alternates between open mouth and closed mouth pictures. In addition to the run function, another function checks the position of the pacman and reverses the direction if need be. To do this, I had to store 4 pictures in an array, and determine which picture to display in that array, and at what position to display them. 

For additional help with syntax issues, visit the JavaScript Guide with MDN 

A cool addition to this project would be to incorporate a ghost chasing the Pacman, or the Pacman eating more dots as it chomps along.
